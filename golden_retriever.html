        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate 
            nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in 
            several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and 
            may be trained for use as a guide dog.  
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of dog. The Golden Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined 
            stop, with dark eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, 
            and ears of moderate size set high and hanging with a slight fold.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The double coat is a recognisable and striking feature. The outer coat is long, flat or wavy and has good feathering on the 
            forelegs, while the undercoat is dense and provides weather resistance.   The coat can be any shade of cream, yellow or gold. 
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            Golden Retrievers are usually healthy dogs that live for 12-13 years. However, due to poor breeding, some Golden Retrievers may 
            have allergies, heart disease, eye issues, hip dysplasia, cancer, hypothyroidism, or a bad temperament. Make sure to do your 
            research when looking to adopt a Golden Retriever, or find a reputable breeder so that medical issues are less likely.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to their thick coats and love for swimming, Golden Retrievers are prone to developing hot spots, localized areas of skin that 
            are inflamed and infected with bacteria. Hot spots develop more often in warm, humid environments and after swimming because moisture 
            gets trapped near the skin by a Golden Retriever's thick fur coat. The moist skin causes discomfort that leads to scratching, chewing, 
            and licking. These behaviors then cause the skin to become inflamed and infected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Atopic Dermatitis (Atopy) is an inflammatory and extremely itchy skin condition that Golden Retrievers are predisposed to, triggered by 
            environmental allergens such as pollen, dust mites, or mold. It's believed to be a genetic predisposition. For dogs with atopy, a vet 
            visit is needed quickly to manage the itch and treat for any skin infection present.
        </p>
        <p>
            Golden Retrievers are also prone to ear infections. To minimize the risk of ear infections in Golden Retrievers, it's best to clean their 
            ears with a product that contains a drying agent (like EPIOTICÂ® Advanced) every 2-3 weeks for maintenance and after swimming 
            or a bath.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            Golden Retrievers can be a great family dog for an active family due to their high energy levels, but also calm natures and intelligence. 
            They can be easy dogs to train and can make good first dogs for new dog owners, as long as you know what you're getting into taking on a 
            larger breed dog.
