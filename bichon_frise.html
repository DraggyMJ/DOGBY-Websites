            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>
                The French word bichon comes from Middle French bichon ('small dog'), a diminutive of Old French biche ('female dog', cognate with English bitch), from Old English bicce, 
                and related to other Germanic words with the same meaning, including Old Norse bikkja, and German Betze. Some speculate the origin of bichon to be the result of the apheresis, 
                or shortening, of the word barbichon ('small poodle'), a derivative of barbiche ('shaggy dog'); however, this is likely impossible, since the word bichon (attested 1588) is older 
                than barbichon (attested 1694). While the English name for the breed, Bichon Frise, is derived from the French bichon à poil frisé meaning 'curly haired small dog'.
            </p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>
                The Bichon Frisé is a small dog that weighs approximately 6-11 kilograms (10-20 pounds) and stands 23-30 centimetres (9-12 inches) at the withers, but slightly larger dogs are not uncommon. The skull is slightly rounded and the muzzle is not pointy. 
                The tail is groomed to be long and curly and is carried over the back. It has a black nose and dark round eyes; its white hair consists of a curly, dense coat with little shedding (much like a poodle in this respect), although many of the breeds do tend to have less curly hair than others. A small amount of buff, cream, or apricot colour may be seen around its ears, snout, paws or body, but normally these colours do not exceed 10% of its body. FCI/AKC Standard coat colour is pure white; other colours such as apricot or grey and brown are not recognised. A white coat is preferred in the show ring. The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body, and the ears and tail are natural (not docked or cropped)
            </p>

            <h1>Health</h1>
            <p>
                The Bichon Frisé is a relatively healthy breed. They may have cataracts, diabetes or allergies, which may lead to skin conditions and cause itching resulting in scratching and chewing their paws. 
                Other health conditions that can be seen in Bichon Frisé are patellar luxation, heart disease, and liver disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Bichon Frisé breeders, the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) recommends screenings for the following health conditions to receive CHIC certification: Hip Displasia, 
                Patellar Luxation, CERF (eye health), cardiac evaluation, and Legg-Calves-Perthes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bichons Frisés are considered to be hypoallergenic as they do not readily shed (moult) and are thus generally suitable for people with allergies.
            </p>

            <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
            <p>
                Most dog owners have issues with walking their dogs on a daily basis due to their busy daily schedules, but with Bichon Frise you have less need for daily walks. 
                There are lots of behavior problems a dog can develop if the dog is left with too much energy without daily walks or other forms of exercise. 
                This is one of the common reasons why people prefer cats to dogs. Because a dog with excessive energy will bark, nip or even bite. 
                With Bichon Frise you don't need daily walks, a little fetch game in your backyard or house is ok to keep your pup going. You can also play food puzzles or hide-and-seek.
