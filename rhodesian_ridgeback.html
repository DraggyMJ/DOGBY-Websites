        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a large scenthound and sighthound dog breed bred in the Southern Africa region. Its 
            forebears can be traced to the semi-domesticated ridged hunting and guardian dogs of the Khoikhoi. These were 
            interbred with European dogs by the early colonists of the Cape Colony of southern Africa. The original breed 
            standard was drafted by F. R. Barnes, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), in 1922, and approved by the 
            South African Kennel Union in 1927. The Rhodesian Ridgeback at present is the only registered breed indigenous to 
            Southern Africa.
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            They come in only one color, wheaten, which spans every shade seen in a wheat field, from pale flaxen to the burnished red 
            of a maturing crop. Ridgebacks also have two nose colors: black and the less commonly seen brown. Handsome, strong, 
            muscular and active dog, symmetrical in outline, capable of great endurance with fair amount of speed.
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            The Rhodesian Ridgeback dog, which has an average lifespan of 10 to 13 years, does not suffer from any serious health conditions. 
            However, it may be prone to minor issues such as elbow dysplasia, canine hip dysplasia (CHD), and hypothyroidism. Deafness 
            and dermoid sinus are also occasionally seen in the breed. 
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            Rhodesian Ridgeback is not ideal for first-time owner because they ridgebacks are very strong-minded and incredibly
            independent. They think for themselves and can be frustratingly stubborn. Although they are highly trainable, they 
            love to do things their way. This requires an equally strong-minded owner thatâ€™s firm, fair, and authoritative.
        </p>
        <p>
            A cramped apartment for a mobile and energetic Ridgeback is not very suitable, especially if he remains alone for a
            long time. From loneliness, a dog can become violent and do a lot of trouble on the premises.
        </p>
        <p>
            This breed required a lot of time to train so that in the future the dog fulfills all commands, obeys, and his submissive. 
            They also required a lot of exercise in order to keep in shape and prevent any destructiveness.
