            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>
                The Poodle, called the Pudel in German and the Caniche in French, is a breed of water dog. The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, 
                Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle variety is not universally recognised. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Poodle most likely originated in Germany, although it is also claimed to be from France. The Standard Poodle was originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water. 
                The smaller varieties of the breed were bred from the original in France where they were once commonly used as circus performers, but have become popular companion dogs.
            </p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>
                The Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the different breed varieties varying predominantly by their size. The FCI's breed standard states the Standard Poodle stands between 45 and 62 centimetres 
                (18 and 24 in), the Medium Poodle between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18 in), the Miniature Poodle between 28 and 35 centimetres (11 and 14 in) and the Toy Poodle 24 and 28 centimetres (9.4 and 11.0 in). 
                Some kennel clubs do not recognise the Medium Poodle variety. Those typically have the Standard Poodle between 38 and 60 centimetres (15 and 24 in) and Miniature Poodle between 28 and 38 centimetres (11 and 15 in), 
                with the toy variety remaining unchanged. A healthy adult Standard Poodle typically weighs between 20 and 32 kilograms (44 and 71 lb), a Medium Poodle between 15 and 19 kilograms (33 and 42 lb), 
                a Miniature Poodle between 12 and 14 kilograms (26 and 31 lb) and a Toy Poodle between 6.5 and 7.5 kilograms (14 and 17 lb).
            </p>

            <h1>Health</h1>
            <p>
                The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles. Overall, the Poodle is a comparatively healthy breed, and there are no Poodle-specific health problems. 
                Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of hereditary diseases due to inbreeding. One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling 
                village dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are sebaceous adenitis (estimated prevalence 2.7%), a skin disease and Addison's disease, an endocrine system disorder. 
                Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid careless breeding aimed at producing good show dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Poodles have a life expectancy of 10-18 years, with the Standard Poodle, like most large dogs, tending to be more short-lived.
            </p>

            <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
            <p>
                The poodle's intelligence and eagerness to please make them easy to train. From basic obedience to tricks, these dogs can master it all. Did you know that in Europe poodles were used as circus performers? 
                That's because they could pick up tricks easily and delight their audiences.
