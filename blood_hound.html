        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The bloodhound is a large scent hound, originally bred for hunting deer, wild boar and, since the Middle Ages, for 
            tracking people. Believed to be descended from hounds once kept at the Abbey of Saint-Hubert, Belgium, in French 
            it is called, <span style="font-style:italic;">le chien de Saint-Hubert.</span>  
        </p>
        <p>
            This breed is famed for its ability to discern human scent over great distances, even days later. Its extraordinarily 
            keen sense of smell is combined with a strong and tenacious tracking instinct, producing the ideal scent hound, and it
            is used by police and law enforcement all over the world to track escaped prisoners, missing people, and lost pets.
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            Bloodhounds weigh from 36 to 72 kg (80 to 160 lbs). They are 58 to 69 cm (23 to 27 inches) tall at the withers. 
            According to the AKC standard for the breed, larger dogs are preferred by conformation judges. Acceptable colors 
            for bloodhounds are black, liver, and red. Bloodhounds possess an unusually large skeletal structure with most of 
            their weight concentrated in their bones, which are very thick for their length. The coat, typical for a scent 
            hound, is hard and composed of fur alone, with no admixture of hair.
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            The lifespan of the Bloodhound is 7 to 12 years. Bloodhounds suffer an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal 
            ailments, with gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem.The breed 
            also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments thus these areas should be inspected frequently
            for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most 
            common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat 
            quickly.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            Overall, Bloodhound is great for hunting and tracking because of their exceptional sense of smell. However, this breed is
            not recommended for first time owner because they can be eaily distracted if theys catch the scent of something 
            interesting. They are active dog so they need a lot of exercise to prevent any destructive behaviour if they get bored.
            They likely make noise sometimes so you need to teach them when they are a puppy with patience.
