            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>
                The German Shepherd or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed 
                by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, 
                including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion 
                dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations 
                in 2013.
            </p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>
                German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. They typically have a predominantly black, square nose and a long, straight muzzle.
                Most German Shepherds have a medium-length double coat. The outer coat is typically dense and straight, but some may be slightly wavy.
                Their coat colors vary wildly and include black and tan, black and cream, black and red, black and silver and bi-color. 
                They have a long, bushy tail with a slight hook like a saber. The ears open toward the front and are particularly 
                erect when the German Shepherd stands at attention.
            </p>
    
            <h1>Health</h1>
            <p>
                A German Shepherd life span is 9 to 13 years. Many common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the 
                inbreeding practised early in the breed's life. One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may 
                cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis.
            </p>
            <p>
                A study conducted by the University of Zurich found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used. 
                The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia. 
                There are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play.
            </p>
            <p>
                German Shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Degenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. 
                A very inexpensive DNA saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. The test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. 
                A small study in the UK showed 16% of young asymptomatic German Shepherds to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers.
            </p>
            <p>
                German Shepherds have a higher-than-normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. 
                It is estimated that 1% of the UK population of German Shepherds has this disease.
            </p>
            <h1>Should I but this breed?</h1>
            <p>
                German Shepherds are good first dogs as they are easy to train, obedient, intelligent, friendly, affectionate, 
                loyal, and good with kids. They make an excellent dog for first-time owners, whether families or single owners. 
                However, they need a lot of exercise, shed a lot, and don’t like to be left alone.
