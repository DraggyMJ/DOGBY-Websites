        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable
            by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking 
            Alaskan Malamute.
        </p>
        <p>
            Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling,
            and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh
            environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the
            Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable 
            terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled 
            dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds.It has two layers: a dense, 
            finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs.[12] It protects the dogs effectively 
            against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, often with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail 
            tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare "agouti"
            coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly
            obliquely." The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable. 
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            Siberian Huskies suffer from common health issues that most dogs are at risk for, like hip dysplasia and eye disease,
            but they are generally a relatively healthy breed of dog. Compared to other breeds, Huskies are known for their ability
            to maintain a healthy weight with less food but still require a high-protein diet. They are clean by nature and are 
            typically free from odor and parasites on their body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Siberian Husky is a healthy breed, they still may suffer from minor health problems such as progressive 
            retinal atrophy (PRA), hypothyroidism, cataract, and corneal dystrophy.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            Siberian Huskies are not a breed for the new or timid owner. They need a strong owner who will maintain an alpha position
            in the home. They need obedience training from a young age and can be a difficult and stubborn breed to train. Owners also 
            needa very secure garden with high fences as Huskies are known for getting up to mischief including escape attempts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other than that, they are very active dogs that need adequate mental and physical stimulation, so a lot of exercise
            is required. They are very friendly dogs that enjoy meeting new people and make excellent running and biking partners
            due to their need to run.
