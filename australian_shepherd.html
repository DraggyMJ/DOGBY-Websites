        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Australian Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States. Developed in California in the 19th 
            century, it is claimed the breed descends from a variety of herding breeds including collies imported into 
            California alongside sheep imported from Australia and New Zealand, the breed taking its name from the former. 
            Originally used solely as a herding dog, the Australian Shepherd has become one of the most popular companion dog
            breeds in North America.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the late-20th century the Australian Shepherd has increasingly been seen in conformation shows and it has 
            become an extremely popular companion dog, in 2019 it was ranked by the American Kennel Club as the 15th most 
            popular breed of dog in the United States.
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized, athletic breed; they typically stand between 18 and 23 inches 
            (46 and 58 cm) and weigh between 35 and 70 pounds (16 and 32 kg). The parent club, the Australian Shepherd Club
            of America's breed standard states dogs should stand between 20 and 23 inches (51 and 58 cm) and inches between
            18 and 21 inches (46 and 53 cm); the standard does allow individual animals to exceed these limits slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Australian Shepherd has a moderately long and wavy double coat that has a dense undercoat and coarse topcoat;
            the coat is short on the face and well feathered on the rear of the legs. The breed is known for its unique colorations
            and variable coat patterns, it being said no two dogs sharing a coat. The breed standard allows for blue merle,
            red merle, solid black or solid red, with or without white markings and with or without tan points.
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            The Australian Shepherd is a generally healthy breed, but there are a few big health issues to look out for. 
            It is prone to several types of eye diseases, the most common of which is cataracts. This is the disease that 
            causes a cloudy appearance in the eye. Other common health issues include hip or elbow dysplasia (a genetic abnormality that causes development problems in the joint), 
            distichiasis (in which additional eyelashes grow around the lid and irritate the eye), deafness, hypothyroidism, allergies, 
            drug sensitivities, and cancer.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            The Australian Shepherd is a moderate to high maintenance breed that requires quite a lot of grooming, exercise,
            and attention. You should only buy this breed if you have the time, inclination, and ability to fully take care 
            of it. You will get the best results if you train and socialize this breed early as a puppy.
