            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                The Bullmastiff is a British breed of dog of mastiff type and large size, with a solid build and a short muzzle. It was developed as a guard dog in the nineteenth century by cross-breeding the English Mastiff with the now-extinct Old English Bulldog. It was recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1924.
            </p>
            <p>The origins of the Bullmastiff are unclear. In the eighteenth century, in some regions of England, the Old English Mastiff and English Bulldog were commonly inter-bred to produce dogs suitable for work guarding people and their property. 
                By the beginning of the twentieth century this cross-breed was in widespread use as an aid to gamekeepers in the control of poaching. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the nineteenth century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. 
                As a result, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog.
            </p>
            <p>The Bullmastiff was recognised as a breed by The Kennel Club in 1924. Dogs had to have a minimum of four generations of descent from Bullmastiff stock without input from either Bulldog or Mastiff; cross-bred animals could not be registered. The American Kennel Club recognised it in 1934. 
                It was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1955.
            </p>
            <p>In 1928, the diamond mining company De Beers imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines.
            </p>
            <h1>Use</h1>
            <p>
                The Bullmastiff is bred to be guard dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bullmastiff is also be used to defend wealthy properties from poachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are also a great companion dogs.
            </p>
    
            <h1>Health</h1>
            <p>
                A Bullmastiff life span is 8 to 12 years. According to a survey in the UK, the median life span of Bullmastiff is 7.5 year.
            <p>
                Health concerns within the breed include hip and elbow dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, bloat, and cancer, with a relatively high incidence of lymphoma and mast cell tumours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bullmastiffs are prone to certain hereditary diseases, including Hip dysplasia, affecting 24.5% of individuals, Elbow dysplasia, affecting 13.8% of individuals, Entropion, hypothyroidism affecting 2.8% of individuals and Lymphoma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Progressive retinal atrophy is a particular problem, since the trait is an autosomal dominant one.
