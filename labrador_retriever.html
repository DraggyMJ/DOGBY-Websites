            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>
                The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), 
                and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Labrador is loyal, obedient and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.
            </p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>
                Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for dogs of 25-36 kg (55-80 lb) and 
                for bitches as 25-32 kg (55-70 lb).The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 55 to 62 centimetres (21.5 to 24.5 in) for dogs and 55 to 60 centimetres (21.5 to 23.5 in) for bitches,[6] The Kennel Club which 
                advises that dogs should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5 in) with bitches between 55 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22 in), and the FCI which quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5 in) for dogs with bitches ideal 
                at 54 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22 in).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to the water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. 
                Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Health</h1>
            <p>
                Healthy Labradors typically live to between 12 and 14 years of age. Labrador pups generally are not brought to the home before they are 8 weeks old.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity (most are missing all or parts of the appetite-regulating POMC gene).
            </p>
            <p>
                A Royal Veterinary College study, and one conducted by The University of Sydney, have concluded that Chocolate Labradors have a shorter average life expectancy than other colours of Labrador 
                (by about 10%) and are more likely to suffer some health problems. It is thought that this is due to breeder's attempts to increase their numbers through selective coat colour breeding at the 
                expense of other important health traits. The brown coat colour is naturally rare (compared to yellow and black), and it has been fashionable since the 1980s. This has created a demand for larger 
                numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Labradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, especially in larger dogs. Eye diseases may include progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. 
                They can suffer from exercise induced collapse, which causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise, or from obesity, which in some cases may be partly 
                due to the absence of part or all of the proopiomelanocortin gene.
            </p>

            <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
            <p>
                One of the many reasons why the labrador retriever has remained so consistently popular is that they are good with children. Whether you are getting a first family pet and have young children or toddlers or you are bringing in a dog to help teach 
                older kids responsibility, the labrador is an ideal companion for kids of all ages.As we always remind pet parents it is important to never leave dogs and young children alone unattended, and you should alway teach children to respect pups and their personal space.
