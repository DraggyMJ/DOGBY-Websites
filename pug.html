        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzle
            d face and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often light 
            brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well developed and thick muscles all over the body.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality 
            as "even-tempered and charming". Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners.
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            While the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to be long and lean, modern breed preferences 
            are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats 
            can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined and there is a trace of a black 
            line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, "rose" and "button". "Rose" ears are smaller than the standard style 
            of "button" ears, and are folded with the front edge against the side of the head.   
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            Pugs are prone to many health issues. Most are related to their brachycephalic conformation. Fortunately, many of 
            their potential health problems can be managed with the assistance of your veterinarian.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Pugs upper respiratory tract is much smaller than other dogs, so they often have to breathe through their mouths. Since 
            dogs use their airways to cool themselves, this increased effort for Pugs leaves them more predisposed to overheating. Excess 
            weight can increase breathing difficulties and make it easier for a Pug to overheat. Keeping your Pug at a healthy weight or 
            on a weight-control diet to prevent obesity. Pug should also avoid strenuous exercise or taking outside during hot weather.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Pugs are also prone to various throats, ears, eyes, folds, and facial infections. Hence they will require regular health check-ups.  
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
          Pugs are friendly, funny, loyal, adorable, and relatively easy to care. They are ideal for first-time owner. They required few exercise
          such as daily walk will be enough for pugs. Even without any exercise, pugs won't be too destructive. However, it should be noted that 
          pugs tend to suffer from respiratory problems due to their short muzzles, and they also can become overweight very easily.
