        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Pomeranian (often known as a <span style="font-weight:bold;">Pom</span>) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in 
            north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the 
            Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the 
            Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as 
            the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Zwergspitz</span> ("Dwarf Spitz").  
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36-3.17 kilograms (3.0-7.0 lb) and standing 8-14 inches (20-36 cm). They are 
            compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat 
            forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the 
            hindquarters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pomeranians have a thick double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to 
            maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1-2 
            months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The 
            coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            The life span of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. The breed does have similar health issues to many other dog breeds, 
            although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health 
            issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Luxating patella is a common health issue in Pomeranians that affects the knee joint. This condition can occur due 
            to a malformation of the bone or from an injury when the kneecap slips out of place. Pomeranians may sporadically 
            show symptoms of luxating patella, typically in the form of sharp pain in their knee caps. Owners may notice that 
            their dog yelps loudly but seems okay afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
            A collapsed trachea is a common health issue with Pomeranians. The trachea (windpipe) is supported by rings that are 
            made out of cartilage. With small dog breeds, the cartilage is more prone to injury. While the condition can be 
            related to genetics, it is preventable in some cases. Signs of tracheal collapse include a unique honking noise, 
            coughing, wheezing, or trouble breathing. Take your Pomeranian to the vet if you suspect he has a tracheal collapse. 
            In very serious cases when Pomeranians don’t respond to other treatment, surgery is performed to stabilize the windpipe.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
          Pomeranians are good dogs for first-time dog owners. They're sweet, affectionate little dogs that love to be around their 
          owners and be social. They require a minimum of two walks a day to be happy and get their exercise needs met. While they 
          shed, regular brushing and grooming can help keep their fur under control.
