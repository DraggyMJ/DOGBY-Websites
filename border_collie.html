        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The Border Collie is a British breed of herding dog of medium size. Widely considered to be the most intelligent dog 
            breed, they are descended from landrace sheepdogs once found all over the British Isles, but became standardised in the 
            Anglo-Scottish border region. They are now mostly used as working dogs to herd livestock, specifically sheep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Border Collies are extremely energetic, acrobatic, and athletic. This means that they need plenty of stimulation and
            exercise. A bored Border Collie can easily become destructive in your home and yard. They frequently compete with great
            success in sheepdog trials and a range of dog sports like dog obedience, disc dog, herding and dog agility. Border 
            Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.
        </p>
        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is more often thick and prone to shedding
            . They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the 
            most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known 
            to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour 
            (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, 
            brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. 
            Some border collies may also have single-colour coats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eye colour varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with 
            merles. The ears of the border collie are also variable some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and 
            others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough collie).
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            The average lifespan of a Border Collie is 10-17 years. The Border Collie is a healthy breed, but it has characteristic
            health conditions. Common genetic diseases are hip dysplasia, collie eye anomaly, progressive retinal atrophy, 
            lens luxation and epilepsy.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            If you're active, with lots of space at your place (like a big backyard or farm), and can give your pet lots of love
            and attention, then a Border Collie could be right for you. Their mental health is in constant need of stimulation, 
            so they can channel that energy and intelligence into active pursuits.
        </p>
        <p>
            They're certainly not apartment dogs, as they need to run, hunt, smell, dig and jump. All that said, Border Collies
            are easily trained. If you're committed to creating a disciplined environment, they could be also perfect match for 
            your family!
