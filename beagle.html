        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed
            primarily for hunting hare known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the 
            beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine 
            around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited 
            health problems.    
        </p>
        <p>
            Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently 
            in film, television, and comic books.
        </p>

        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
            Beagles are muscular, solid dogs with a slightly domed skull. Their muzzle is squarish and the nose broad. Ears are 
            long and droopy. Their chest is deep, back is straight and they have a moderately long tail that is carried high. 
            The breed's smooth, dense coat is usually black, tan, and white
        </p>
        <h1>Health</h1>
        <p>
            The lifespan for the Beagle is 12 to 15 years. While the breed is overall quite a healthy one, it can experience health
            problems such as epilepsy, cherry eyes, cruciate ligament disease, and ear infection. Fortunately, each of these conditions 
            can be treated by your local veterinarian. If you notice any unusual symptoms in your Beagle, contact your vet immediately.
        </p>
        <h1>Should I buy this breed?</h1>
        <p>
            Beagles are generally considered to be good first-time dogs due to their smaller size and even-tempered personality. 
            They are adaptable and fit well into most environments. However, Beagles are among the most difficult canines to train 
            because they can get easily distracted due to their inquisitive nature, stubbornness, and sharp sense of smell. 
            Therfore, they required a lot of obedience training and exercise to prevent any stubborn or destructive behaviour. It's
            wise to supervise them around small children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beagles are fundamentally pack dogs and don’t tend to enjoy being alone for long periods. They are happiest in the 
            company of their owners or other pets.
